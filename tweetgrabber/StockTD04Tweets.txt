life is a tale told to a psychiatrist who can only see you for 15 minutes
my antidepressants have decided to unionize inside my body and are pressuring each other not to work
my antidepressants are protesting the working conditions in my body and have gone on strike
my antidepressants feel like they’re on vacation
i’m not getting stronger every day

“good” morning
my life is totally destroying my life
it’s 5 AM in LA and i’ve been up all night because my dog has never before heard the sound of wind AMA
scared of anyone who has to say “practice kindness” as a reminder
when people talk shit about me what do you think they say?
i don’t want to live in a world where—actually i just don’t want to live in a world
oh great it’s an opportunity for personal growth
you should love me for me even though i totally don’t

bitch i use my negative attitude in a positive way
well i'm getting uglier
found someone thanks internet
oops, it felt like self-love but it was self-destruction

yeah sex is cool, but have you ever watched two people you dislike equally fight online
can you feel my anxiety through the internet
ta;dr  too annoying didn’t read
if you can’t handle me in my acute panic attack then you don’t deserve me in my general sense of persistent underlying doom
just thought “i hope you miss my pussy” and then “should i tweet that?” and then “no”
i have a headache, probably because i exist
where does it hurt?  *points to existence*

had a sex dream about panda express
there is so much to be grateful for, like not being at a writers’ conference
i’m cool when i’m alone
i drank to not be human; to stay sober i must allow myself to be human

tired but tired
my dog has taught me the deepest love i’ve ever known and has zero respect for me
oh fuck i’m having a memory
i just want to go to sleep on top of a giant marshmallow while eating the marshmallow is that too much to ask?!
too tired to reclaim my power or whatev
capitalism is making me want to vomit and also buy stuff
me: fuck authority  also me: can somebody just tell me what to do
i might not like anyone
my nemesis is obviously me
maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s compulsive engagement in pleasurable habits despite their negative consequences
i sexually identify as a vague sense of impending doom
i don’t have to prove anything to anyone! (except the negative voices in my head and anyone who ever rejected me)
i’m nothing but whatev

i want sex and to be alone

i keep getting older and it’s not good
deleting tweets is a basic human right
meet me at the corner of insomnia and difficulty living in the world
things i’m good at:  not knowing when to stop
can’t believe this life thing is still going on
everybody wants you to be as crappy and boring as them
i feel like i should be better
the glass may be half full but i don’t like what’s in it

i’m an entrepreneur of ways to feel shitty
catastrophic thinking &amp; fear of the future, crushes on strangers &amp; blaming myself for everything, these are a few of my favorite things
i’m not sure what my worldview is but i know it’s not great
fleeing reality in horror like a boss
if i can’t torture myself about it i don’t want to be involved
pretending you are interesting because i need someone to obsess about
i can already tell that my fate is going to suck
spoiler: when people say it’s going to be ok they don’t reallllly know
if i could just control the uncontrollable nature of reality everything would be chill

i like to blame myself for everything just in case
*looks at self in mirror*  doesn’t spark joy
i would “reach out for help” if it meant a team of dogs would come to my rescue
i don’t ask for help because then i have to deal with people
oh great another hour of my life
want to throw myself in the trash in a creative way
when someone believes in me i’m like what’s wrong with you?
i wake up, i think about life for a moment, i go back to bed
i’m obviously not enough
memories are trying to kill me
self-destructive in a gentle way

*gives a vague cry for help but also doesn’t want to talk to anyone*
horoscope: just don’t do anything
studies confirm i’m my own worst enemy
i have a good life and depression
high on insecurity
if you need me i’ll be overcompensating for my innate feeling of inferiority
*whispers during sex* everything has gotten so annoying
“are you gonna let some loser who talks shit about you ruin your whole day?”  “definitely”
today’s tweets are sponsored by fear of the future, an inability to be still with myself and an inability to be still with anyone else
i never leave home without my childhood trauma

roses are red violets are blue no one really knows why we’re here
i think it would be best for both of us if you’d be obsessed with me
"love will save you" -art "love will save you" -music "love can't save you" -therapist
sometimes i worry about how much i sleep but then i just go back to sleep
getting out of bed is no longer part of my life
don’t worry, things may feel hopeless now but they’ll get better soon and then be hopeless again
if i know someone doesn’t like me i automatically think they are amazing
i’d rather get an unsolicited dick pic than an unsolicited piece of writing

grammy for peeing 80 times a day
grammy for excessive sleeping
i’ve been tired for 20 years
can i interest you in being obsessed with me
maybe if i keep tweeting this my mother will have loved me unconditionally as a child
oh no i might be maturing
i thought you were deep but you were just hot and quiet: a love story
think positive!  don’t tell me what to do

my self-esteem was good for 30 seconds
i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by not getting texted back
never want to be part of any “current moment”
you need to learn how to be fake better
honk if you're sick of your own bullshit
i perceive everything as a rejection just to be safe
it’s rare when something isn’t a piece of shit
my mind is a conspiracy against myself
*whispers during sex* i should probably be back in therapy
everything is annoying
let me know how i can best prepare for you to reject me
i was fine till you gave me hope

i’m not a nihilist i’m just always tired
why ft. bother?
getting out of bed is so last year
all my goodbyes are happy because i just want to get the fuck out of there
i have a headache, probably from being confronted with my own cosmic insignificance
when people are nice to me i feel guilty: a love story
i'm not moisturized, hydrated or full of self love and it's fine
i love you but i've chosen masturbation
“i’ve never come from penetration alone!” i call into the wind, before beginning my descent of mount everest
i'm either obsessing or sleeping
10 people like me me: they don't count 1 person hates me me: they are everything

comparing myself to others and losing
can you feel my desperation through the internet
i'm only obsessed with you to distract myself from death
can't tell if i'm losing it or i've lost it
am i an independent woman or just scared of everyone and isolated
your "positive energy" scares the shit out of me
your "positive energy" scares the shit out of me
i'm aware of what i'm doing but not enough to stop
i don't care what anyone thinks about me except i totally do
i mean, like if you count skittles, panda express and taco bell as antifa
like i’m basically the rose emoji #theresistance
i can’t say my “show” is good but what i can say is that it’s free, short and “anti-capitalist” bc i will never figure out how to do ads

if you won't reject me i'll do it for you
brb, misdirecting my anger inwardly
brb, misdirecting my anger inwardly
dreamt we fucked
i came, i saw, i went back to therapy
i'm a self-made mess
i was okay and then i wasn’t
sorry, i can’t, i’ve lost interest in things i once found pleasurable
strangely, i feel sad
could being alive be any more painful? asking for a friend
sometimes it's like "how are people so content?" and then i'm like oh yeah i'm mentally ill
one time i had a safe space but then i was born
live, laugh, love, channel existential anxiety into obsessions about bullshit, forget you are going to die, remember and be like fuck
being american is making me nauseous
no i don’t believe in myself, what do i look like someone who believes in themself?
am i an influencer yet?
would love to make new mistakes instead of the old ones
pretend you haven't forgotten about me
depression is like "i'm always here for you baby"
by happy i mean moderately depressed
good morning and welcome to the terror of being alive
things i'll never get over: -being born -adolescence -you
can you not give me hope
whenever i say yes to hanging out it's like i'm watching the word come out of my mouth in slow motion and trying desperately to stop it
but enough about me...here’s more about me
someone asked me how i was doing and i told them and it was too much
looking forward to being invisible to you again
being born is a lot of pressure
me: capitalism is a wasteful and depleting force  also me: i want like 5 new coats, a convertible and a horse
everyone seems to be blurring into one big blur of disgustingness
body type: kind of a prison for my spirit
70% off self-esteem
30% off calling everything fascist until the word no longer means anything
one thing i don't like is the way things are
it feels good to know you suck now
attempting to control an uncontrollable world through my food intake
did i happen to mention i hate everything
i was only the winning sperm because i was trying to prove something to another sperm who had ghosted me
even when i was a sperm i was like, do i have to?
i'm fine to be around people for 5 minutes or less
no therapist can prepare you for your family
excited to be socially awkward and self-conscious
it's important to give up on everything first thing in the morning
assistant to the regional manager of paranoia
turn-ons include being ignored
everything is shit
so what if i’m sexually attracted to a bag of pretzels
i pretend to be this 🌖🌵🌺  but i’m this 🥨🥨⚰️
i don’t want to die but i want the part after
thankful for mortality
trying to break up with myself
got over you but then forgot
my version of a social life is wondering if you still think about me
how depressing could it be? (very depressing)
torturing myself over things that don't matter is going ok
in space no one can hear your dumb opinion
excited to fuck up again
am i actually supposed to, like, live my life?
when you see the emptiness in everything i'll be here for you
being a disappointment to my mother is going great
brb, i'm imagining the worst
i have enough anxiety for 10 people
sorry, i can't, i'm babysitting my depression tonight
i’m basically only on there so if the end finally comes for twitter i can still get a little dopamine
ever just walk around like how am i not dropping dead right now
need to warn you that i'm going to be a disappointment
*trusts self*  ok never doing that again
year of the i'm a piece of shit
*looks in the mirror*  i feel personally attacked
the dopamine giveth and the dopamine taketh away
the dopamine giveth and the dopamine taketh away
*sets healthy boundaries* *lights them on fire*
i’m not that special (and other things i’ve learned): a memoir
if he DMs you for sex he’s also DMing 50 other people for sex (and other things i’ve learned): a memoir
I don't feel at peace unless I'm torturing myself
where do you live?  trapped inside myself
feeling is a disaster
i'm just trying to not live my life
my feelings are never not hurt
*whispers during sex* do you think people like me?
can you just give me a ten minute warning before you abandon me forever thx
you had me at cremation urn
the miracle of life is annoying
ever just feel tired for your entire life
i’m starting to think that feelings are just going to keep happening
not having a crush on anyone is going to kill me
hello compulsion my old friend
my version of impulse control is just regret
it's not that everything is meaningless but
a positive feeling can fuck you up forever
let's fuck up my life
can’t decide if i’m dying
i miss accepting crumbs from you and perceiving them as giant loaves of bread
i miss pretending we had genuine intimacy
i miss the mistakes that caused me pain before they caused me pain
i miss people who were wrong for me when i was still in denial that they were wrong for me
i miss people i never even liked in the first place
depressed in a whole new way
almost believed in myself but then didn’t
i’m definitely pansexual
sorry i can't go to your party i'm scared of human interaction
my most endearing quality is not talking to anyone
*sees red flags*  *ignores them*
sorry but the password must contain the euphoric moment before you cum and the depressing moment after
i love when i’m not awake
bitch i am a depression nap
hmmmm, can’t decide between cold cruel humanity and my warm soft dog
i’m only interested in going back to sleep
let’s softly destroy my life
“if you follow so sad today unfollow me”  *i cum*
sexual fantasies about people screenshotting my tweets and talking shit about them without me knowing
sext: i'm getting uglier
i'm a loser and it's fine
when you realize the person you were obsessed with is just a person, it's sad
things i fear: -the unknown  -the known
recovering from being alone by being alone
if it involves other people it's not my thing
i ❤️ death
hobbies include perceiving a good thing as a bad thing
“no problem” -me lying
"i'm ashamed to be alive" -me flirting with someone
low self-esteem is a full time job
it makes me feel better about not being cool to remember i was never cool
if i vote but don’t tweet performatively about voting does my vote still count
me: i believe in forgiveness  also me: just found my childhood bully on facebook and wanna catfish her husband with fake nudes
i'm not bad at masturbating
hi, i'm an existential hole
romantic obsession is my sport
i don't need to sleep forever just for 1000 years
my natural state is feeling like a loser
*whispers during sex* i've lost interest in things i once enjoyed
if it's not a nap i can't be involved
help me not be myself
pretending this is all a movie
it may be the apocalypse but i'm still thinking about sex
i only give 5 fucks but they're all very obsessive
“it’s all good” -me when it’s not good at all
help me not be myself
destroy my life in a cute way
i have a headache from life being really long
i’m probably going to end up just being nothing
if you can’t handle me at my insomnia then you don’t deserve me at my sleeping all day
my funeral will be the first party i enjoy
kinda jealous of people who have lives but not really
kinda jealous of people who have lives but not really
wish i could wear a mask every day
i want to be invisible but also hot
#imwithcorn #TheResistance
i am so sick and tired of people talking shit about candy corn, stop making me do the emotional labor of defending the corn!!
self-promoting my funeral
oh no i'm still me
am i whole yet?
powered by paranoia
don't worry, things may feel hopeless now but they'll get better soon and then be hopeless again
wouldn't say i have a death wish but i don't have a life wish either
*whispers during sex* i’m actually thinking of cake right now
regret or it didn't happen
"i can tell they don't like me anymore" -me about everyone
goddamn it hurts to be alive
sad
i’m old but my zits make me look young
can’t believe time is just gonna like keep going
most of my thoughts are a disease
it is possible that i don’t like anybody
nothing good happens out of bed
god has a plan for me (to die)
stop peer pressuring me to be empowered
i don’t love my body
try to ignore life
i’m cynical because, like, look around
i could sleep for 24 hours and wake up and need a nap
everyone i've written a love poem for is the worst
talents include checking in on my anxiety every five seconds just to make sure it's still there
when people cancel plans it feels like being saved from the brink of death
worrying about death and my hair at the same time
brb, trying to control what people who don't matter think of me
i miss when empathy wasn’t a corporate marketing ploy
stop peer pressuring me to engage with society
taking my mental illness out for dinner
can't decide if i'm functional
"this is the last straw" -me every day
beautiful death energy
awww look at these cute red flags
anyone who calls themself a life coach is terrifying
anxiety triggers: -not eating enough -eating
it's important to hate everything
life is what happens when i'm avoiding life
politicians texting me like bros who want sex and then after the election they’ll ghost
sometimes i feel like i don’t have a partner, sometimes i feel like my only friend...
we both knew i wasn't enough
doing stuff that isn't sleeping is hard
that which does not kill you but makes you sleep all day
listen, it's not my fault i don't love myself
listen, it's not my fault i don't love myself
ask me anything
i think you've mistaken my low self-esteem for kindness
ignore at first sight
high on existential dread
*watches life fall apart*
i don’t have a brand i have a compulsive need to escape myself
want to touch my anxiety?
person: hi  me: i'm sorry i'm not enough
how doomed do you think i am?
no i can’t just “believe in myself”
high on soda
every time i get out of bed is a disaster
i never know what the hell anyone is talking about
feeling hopeless dot gov
5 moods in 5 minutes
it has been confirmed that i am not enough
come over and give up on me
here let me just rip my heart out and give it to you
seems like everyone is a professional selfie taker and i'm just eating cereal
just spent 2 hours with people so now i need a week alone
don't mind me I'm not really alive
hating myself just seems natural
bitch i am fear of failure
look, i hate myself as much as the next guy
bucket list:  -go back to bed
will probably hate my body till like 5 minutes before i die and then be like wait
i liked you better when you were imaginary
1. wake up 2. try to figure out who hates me so i can waste my life attempting to win their love
can I count on you to let me down?
oh fuck i'm still me
when i'm by myself i'm almost ok
hell! starring other people
*apologizes to person who wronged me for them wronging me*
should i go to bed bath and beyond?
i feel guilty for things i didn’t even do
let's spend the rest of our lives thinking about each other except i get to stop thinking about you but you have to keep thinking about me
watching myself fuck up in slow motion
*panics over something dumb*
i’m at subway living my dreams
no i can't just "get out of bed"
for some of us, tomorrow is also mental health awareness day and also the next day and the next day and the next day
i think my house is haunted but unfortunately not by anything cool that’s trying to kill me
"you might be my soulmate" -me to 100000 people
consciousness is a disaster
*sees red flags*  *ignores them*
protect me from what i want and also from what i don't want and also from having to talk to anyone
i came, i saw, i felt like people were judging me
oops, totally didn't mean to be emotionally honest
"it just gives me a lot of anxiety" --me about everything
unfortunately i'm very self-aware
unfortunately i'm very self-aware
step 1: wake up step 2: be not enough
powerpoint presentation of my insecurities
it takes 374621962558361 x the amount of time you knew someone to get over them
getting over people is a fucking miracle
making the same mistakes and expecting different results and lovin it
inside i'm sleeping
imagining a world without frat boys
i hate you come over
i did everything wrong today and i did it with low self-esteem
siri, how can i be a good person but without any discomfort on my part
i feel upset but not surprised by humanity
sorry to hear about your positive attitude
sun in no, moon in oh fuck, i need to be alone rising
what the fuck is everything
i feel empty and unsure dot com
what if my destiny sucks
watching myself get more insecure in slow motion
just ignore the cold universe
"this is the worst feeling" --me about any feeling
officially at war with my body
in theory i'm totally over you
it's all good --me lying
every day is depression awareness day
got over you but then saw you again
meditating on my shittiness
just forgot that life is pain and then remembered again
sun in 7-11, moon in subway, cheesecake factory rising
let's pretend i'm better looking than i am
so sad today
when you realize everything is stupid it feels lonely
take a lot of naps and ignore a lot of people
if you're insecure, anxious, self-obsessed and lonely at least be amazing at it
i'm so not necessary
yeah i retweet myself i got a fuckin problem
reminder that after 5 minutes i always want to leave
i’m either acting out or hiding from everything
i pretend to be strong so people will leave me alone
not to toot my own tweet but is the nobel committee even paying attention or are they too busy with someone “curing diseases”
i mean these are some hot tweetems right here
let’s all take a moment and be brutally honest with ourselves...my tweets are really good tonight
should i just casually destroy my life
what do you mean you don’t think it’s weird we are alive
i'm always late for everything because i don't want to be anywhere
so annoyed that fantasy isn't reality
if i have to watch my whole life flash before my eyes when i die i'm going to be so annoyed
everything is so full of shit
being born is so mean
brb, the world has fallen short of my unrealistic expectations
no i don't have any self esteem, what do you think i am a person with self-esteem?
time heals all wounds no it doesn't
omg i love your opinion about bullshit
insecurity is forever
shopping list: -self-esteem -the ability to say no without feeling like a bitch -a few moments of peace -new body
ever just feel paranoid as fuck for your entire life
*whispers during sex* i just needed to escape myself
i want to make out with 100 people and also be alone
i have to be punched in the face by my loneliness before i reach out to someone
should we bother being in each other's lives if we can't make out
it’s not my fault i’m from another planet
i prefer dark shitty places
cause of death: your positive attitude
your dumb life looks better than my dumb life on the internet, you win!
people like to feel part of something stupid
i’m bad at breathing
i can’t stop peeing: the musical
i approach everything from a place of oh no
it's important to make everything awkward
i'm bad for me
it's always mental health awareness week in my body
it's always mental health awareness week in my body
breaking news: still afraid of feelings
be your own apocalyptic nightmare
it gets better and then it gets worse and then it gets better but you're like nah i don't trust it
there are two kinds of people in this world and i’m hiding from them both
*me flirting with someone* so i've never liked living in a body
watching people be normal and i just don't understand
i’m not a courageous person i’m just impulsive
i think i’m pansexual but too lazy to change my driver’s license from bisexual so
je suis diagnosing myself with a fatal illness
help i can't stop thinking
pretend you miss me thanks!
hire me to dj your party while laying on the floor
if i was a DJ i would do it laying down
i love you so i can never speak to you again
forbidden love...because unforbidden love is for those who are okay with genuine intimacy™️
i have decided that i am doomed
je suis at war with myself
i'm a worst case scenario
find what you love and maintain a fear of intimacy
i think i’ll spend the day imagining the worst
body negativity
if you can’t handle me at my insomnia all night then you don’t deserve me at my sleeping all day
having carefully read your tweets, i’ve reached the conclusion that you’re all very annoying
for the love of god can someone just get me out of my body
*whispers during sex* i hate having a body
obsessing over a problem that doesn't exist
when is my new body scheduled to arrive
i hope my obituary is good
if i don't love myself by now it's not gonna happen
body type: not great
oh fuck i woke up
stop peer pressuring me not to torture myself
excited for my expectations to turn into resentments
is body dysmorphia still body dysmorphia if i’m actually gross?
i miss you never contact me again
cause of death: couples calling each other "babe"
i’m officially done growing as a person. thank you.
i’m definitely getting grosser
writing is so isolating which is why it’s my sport
sorry, i can't, i'm busy watching everything get worse
one small positive thought in the morning can disappoint the shit out of you for the rest of the day
sorry but i hate everything more than you do
i'll give me something to cry about
the good thing about never expressing my needs is no one knows how crazy they are
i'm 44% sex dreams, 56% cereal
blood type: self-doubt
what do you mean the universe can't just cater to my every desire?
my body is a hotel for anxiety
sleeping all day speaks louder than words
my attitude was good for two minutes
my self-hatred is organic
*makes emotional progress*  *throws it in the trash*
i eat existential dread for breakfast
you better not get over me
trying to get excited about my inner beauty
internet: we NEED to talk about-  me: nah
pretending i forgot about you
i'm good at feeling like shit
well my blood has turned to cereal
planet earth isn't my first choice
is this nauseous feeling life or death
if you like death you'll love...me
anxiety or it didn't happen
i want my cremation urn to have wi-fi
get attached to me
get attached to me
i'm basically just a nap waiting to happen
*whispers during sex* trust no politician
i love comforting myself with compulsive behaviors
curing loneliness with isolation
as long as i die instantaneously i’m totally fine with any kind of death
might be eating alone in a rental car for a bit
this morning a dude reversed his jeep without looking, hard, smashing into my car, then said “sorry i’m having a bad day”
feeling a bit...sad
i don't have fear of missing out, i have fear of being invited
good morning and welcome to the terror of being alive
sext: writing bad poetry about you
“i’m disgusting” -me doing positive affirmations
was awake for an hour so it's time to go back to sleep
i regret everything
happiness is cancelled
today’s tweets sponsored by denial, escapism, and an inability to be still with myself or face reality
when i stop trying to crawl back to the womb it’s over for you bitches
mom: happy birthday  me: what the fuck were you thinking?
if you don’t like me i'm obsessed with you
wanna come over and compare suffering?
95% of my ideas are bad and the other 5% i don't act on
i’m old and gross
horoscope: more mistakes coming soon
if you aren't thinking about me you should be
brb, wasting my life
not going to get attached not going to get attached  not going to get attached  *gets attached*
my mind wants me dead but it's fine
just gonna do this to make sure it's still a bad idea
despite all my rage i am still conflict averse
annoyed that the church of satan has branded the pentagram, like let satan be free! satan belongs to all of us!
decided to just start posting pentagrams
no i don't want you to be happy
in my phone your name is NO
oh great another day
people: just be yourself   me: who is that?
should i make it prettier or uglier
crying in supermarkets is an art
society: hi me: no
when i learn how to live in the world it's over for you bitches
myth: parties are fun
if you've subtweeted one boy you've subtweeted them all
[political tweet]
by relaxed i mean very anxious
i don't know how to live in the world
person: can i be a guest on your show?  me: you mean my show called eating ALONE in my car?
let’s pretend i’m alt
i love that my show isn’t monetized, it makes me feel alt
embarrassed to be alive
i give really good advice to everyone except me
want to sleep for 100 days and wake up and eat 100 days worth of food
my heart is stupid
two roads diverged and i took the one where i didn’t have to feel shit
so done with porn  *watches porn*
i always forget i have depression and believe my thoughts are an objective truth regarding the certainty that i am fucked
when i'm simultaneously trying to get attention and hide from the world that's the real me
hobbies: -being left alone
oh no i’m alive
oops, the reasons i created for staying alive are trying to kill me
liked myself for two seconds and then didn't again
gave up on everything but then forgot to stay given up
i make the most beautiful problems for myself
sorry that my suffering isn't the right brand
sorry that my suffering isn't the right brand
fall asleep on the dick
great, i'm alive and filled with longing for things that don't exist
i like to not do anything about my problems but still worry about them
i was rejected by my mother for eating cake as a child #ShareYourRejection
so what if my most intimate relationship is with a cake
i'm hungry but not sure if i deserve to exist: the musical
eating and masturbating
small talk requires 100% more energy than making out
people: don’t joke about depression  me: would you prefer i cry about it?
what's wrong with me? asking for a friend
"i'm a fucking loser, i'm nothing" -me trying to do positive affirmations
whatever i'm doing i'm actually crying
if i'm relatable you're fucked
horoscope: you shouldn't text him but you will
sorry, i know we're having sex but i'm can't stop thinking about mean things people might be saying about me: a memoir
sext: let's be honest, you didn't like me as much as i liked you
this is so fascinating and relatable *points to death*
i either think about you or think about death
oh cool, society is still gross
do you control your fear or does your fear control you?!  my fear controls me.
me: i'm dying me: you're not dying me: i'm dying me: you're not dying me: i'm dying
i'm scared of people, loneliness, being too much, not being enough, intimacy, rejection, dying, and being alive
the shit that scares you probably won't happen but other bad shit definitely will
now researching: what's wrong with me?
"look on the bright side"  "no"
time doesn't really heal anything but sometimes you find someone new to obsess about
i came, i saw, i blamed myself for everything
let's feel bad for each other
quoth the raven, don’t text him
it's important to be a mess
current mood: fucked
well i'm not enough
i was supposed to be hotter
being alive is a major problem
sometimes i forget i have depression and it’s like is everyone else just pretending they aren’t horrified that they exist
waiting for a text seems like a legit career
might start an anonymous twitter
i didn’t know the revolution would be so boring
text me back: the musical
life's a bitch and then you think it's maybe going to be okay for a sec and then it's a bitch again
gonna go give a blow job
"get it together" --my dog
oh look it’s a hell of my own making
i really liked you. i mean, I didn't but everyone else is worse
just sitting here quietly thinking I'm a loser
human existence has always been a disaster so at least there's that
what you call “producing” i call “i downloaded some free apps infected with spyware that cut mp3s in half and stitch them back together”
i'll show you my emptiness if you show me yours
this account is so 2012
share a coke with social anxiety
leaving the house and other bad ideas
there are so many hot people i'm so upset
first name existential last name crisis
had a feeling and buried it in under 1 second
that which does not kill you but makes you slowly retreat from the world
hypersensitive before it was cool
TED talk about staying in bed
high on loneliness
*whispers during sex* i’m insecure so sometimes i retweet my own tweets and then un-retweet
well well well if it isn’t excruciating self-doubt
in a relationship with a muffin
i came, i saw, i got rejected
my first reaction to anything is oh no
me: consumerism is poisoning my soul  me: omg i need all this shit i don’t need
breaking news: still don’t love myself
let’s just call it capitalist self-indulgence and leave “self-love” alone
there are two kinds of people in this world and i don’t understand either of them
let me down in a more exciting way
let me down in a more exciting way
in a complicated relationship with the amount of shit i have to do just to stay alive
please keep society away from me, thx
my aesthetic is fear and anxiety
spoiler: your parents fucked you up

trust your heart just kidding
hated everything before it was cool
"still obsessed with you" --my tombstone
one time i tried to be positive and it was a disaster
woke up confirmed i hate everything  went back to bed
i miss the illusion of you

my superpower is my mother only loved me conditionally
i think i've been alive too long

i've never fit in and it's like thank fucking god
i'm not thinking positively and it's fine
existence is a major inconvenience

i hate that we had a connection
turn-offs include waking up
everyone over there looks like they are really enjoying life today, it’s so bad
holidays hurt my feelings
why are people doing stuff?
today in history: i felt anxious
my gift to humanity is not having kids
fuck you
just felt a flicker of self-esteem and was like what the fuck is this
no offense but i'm glad you're all going to die too
studies show that i'm the worst
that will only cause you pain  ok cool i'm gonna do it!!!!
loving you was an illness
why are people always asking questions where they assume you have a life?
lied to an uber driver that i have fourth of july plans because i felt like he wanted me to

horoscope: uh oh
if i do my eyebrows right will i be whole
i have one good selfie and it's from five years ago
when people call me “queen” or “mom” i get way too excited because i lack a core sense of self-esteem
people on instagram will like anything
been awake ten minutes and already regret today
my beautiful, dark, twisted cap’n crunch fantasy
yes, please do fuck with my head
i hate myself so easily
what you call a nervous breakdown i call oops, accidentally saw things as they are
waking up today was a disappointment
this too shall pass and come back worse
tell the things i once enjoyed that i say hey
sext: i'm ashamed of how much i tweet
that which does not kill you but makes you seek validation from total strangers online
that which does not kill you but makes you cling to harmful defense mechanisms like a soft blanket
you: hi me: [entire story of adolescence + hint about sex + advance warning of all my flaws so you know i know about them before you do]
let's check and see if we're still bad for each other
i'm doing absolutely nothing tonight with absolutely no friends if you wanna come

trying to have sex with the past
it's never too late to have a meltdown
am i acting out? yes. does it ever end well? no. does it lead me into a spiral of obsession? definitely. is it beautiful? so beautiful.

brb, becoming what i hate
she died as she lived: feeling like she was about to die
i am anxiety
scared of dying and scared of being alive at the same damn time
you had me at forgetting about me
how is life still happening
i've been tired a lot lately so obviously i'm dying
listen, you're not doing either of us any favors by not being obsessed with me
i miss ex-boyfriends who were never my boyfriend
positive thinking won't change the fact that we're going to die
spoiler: still not enough
everyone on instagram is pretending life is better than it is
body type:  definitely getting worse
don't recommend me anything except cereal and a peaceful death
this too shall pass and come back as an emotional attachment to the wrong person
"this won't end well" -everything
it’s a weird world over there and it hurts
me: i’m an introvert  also me: tells internet everything
too anxious to sit still, too depressed to move
everything happens for a stupid reason
mood: abandoned building
take a selfie at my funeral
it’s not going well.
have a good isolation i mean weekend
someone suggested “taking a selfie” as a treatment for depression symptoms and i’m like bitch that’s a cause
should i start posting pics of my ass?
also why is everyone hot
as an addict this was a bad idea
anxiety comes to those who wait
i hate everything
what if i become a ‘lifestyle’ blogger 😂
i just used a hashtag, i’m in hell
i already hate this
this is gonna be a disaster
ok so it looks like nobody is coming to rescue me from me
university of insomnia
i came, i saw, i got self-conscious
my aesthetic is waking up terrified
bleeeeeggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
staying alive is a lot of fucking pressure
love watching you pretend to be an activist
i'm a spiritual being having a human experience i didn't ask for
ok, here's the thing, you have to rescue me from myself
if it involves leaving the house it's not my thing
oh yeah also the pisces by melissa broder

q: is everything getting shittier?  a: yes
sad weekend
find what you love and ignore it
my self-esteem is in retrograde

je suis very alone
brb, diagnosing myself with a fatal illness

someone said i suck and i'm like can't argue that one
brb, regretting major life decisions

lonely but don't want to see people
life goals: 1. sleep forever

i’m like an olympic snowboarder  now only burton is low calorie ice cream and the mountain is my bed
bitch i’m famous
uh oh, felt a hopeful feeling
body type: existential dread
i came, i saw, i felt like i was suffocating
you say potato, i say inevitable death
I will always be there for you because I have no life
i was born not ready
powered by bad decisions
when i’m compulsively binge tweeting that’s the real me
oops i didn't mean to be born
i'm 36% existential dread, 31% romantic obsession, 33% compulsive tweeting
sext: i’m back in therapy
just thought “i’m awesome” like my therapist told me to and then thought “no”

never getting over anything
💕🍓🌺💕🍓🌺💕  🌺you mad bro?🍓 💕🍓🌺💕🍓🌺💕
me: why do you want me dead?  my mind: it just seems so peaceful
having a new crush is going to keep me alive and then it will kill me
stages of regret: 1. every decision
when people say “love yourself” what the fuck, specifically, does that mean?
to do: -ignore your opinion
missing: serotonin  if found, please return to: me
i might have depression
"i'm one of the good ones" -one of the bad ones
i’m a disappointment to my parents and they are a disappointment to me
people's natural beauty really hurts my feelings
i’m emotionally available but only if you’re emotionally unavailable
i want to donate all my blood
it's ok to be lonely everyone is
i don’t know what anything is
i came, i saw, i wondered whether i deserve to live on the planet
it doesn't matter that yesterday i felt like i was dying and didn't die, today i'm definitely dying
mayor of low self-esteem
no one emailed me to go on their podcast so i might start my own podcast where i just eat alone in the car
maybe she's born with it, maybe it's insomnia
ok email me if u want me to go on
what podcast should i go on
i'm old and crappy
i wouldn't call it anxiety so much as dying without dying
you can say a lot of things about me but you can’t say that deep inside i don’t know this about myself
when it all comes down to it i know i’m just a tuna fish sandwich
*whispers during sex* do you think i’m enough?
this will be broadcast from my house. hopefully i can figure out which way to angle the phone so as not to look butt. pickle will be there.
it's going to get worse before it gets worse

i can be obsessed with five people who are wrong for me at the same time
i'm an organ donor and it might be time
just another existential crisis
should i take a shower
a panic attack inside a panic attack
look ma, no serotonin
my mom still isn't proud of me happy mother's day
accidentally told my mom i wished i was dead
too busy thinking about myself to be a hater
i feel sad
insecurities so deep the abyss be like whoa
climbing mt. dopamine
climbing mt. dopamine
i like long walks in my head and a love that can never happen
she died as she lived: kind of ready for it but not really
just because you think your kid is cute doesn't mean i have to smile at it
i’m always staring at people because i’m just like shocked they’re ok w being alive
brb, i'm ignoring red flags
a romantic obsession a day keeps the meaningless nature of existence away
when good things happen: what a nice accident!  when bad things happen: it's all my fault
*someone else achieves something*   i need to do that  *i achieve same thing*  this means absolutely nothing
haight street: origin of my worst body mod. come for the story, stay for the fish sex!

cause of death: got out of bed
where did all these feelings come from and where can i put them
can’t tell if i’ve been abandoned forever at the bottom of a deep, dark well or just at my parents’ house for a night
does anyone want to be my mom?
my parents: hi  me: oh this is why i’m like this
one problem with depression is that when good things happen you still have depression
just gonna accept that all i want to do is sleep and move on...by sleeping
going back to bed forever
maybe she's born with it, maybe it's because people were mean to her in junior high

anxious about anxiety
my parents are coming and every page of this book has pussy eating and i don't know what to read
i’ve been awake 5 minutes and it's already too much
she died as she lived: worried she was dying
if you can't handle me at my panic attacks, then you don't deserve me at my still filled with general anxiety but not totally suffocating
if i'm not making out or eating i want to be asleep
going to get called out for appropriating pisces culture
btw, i’m not a pisces  i’m a virgo, scorpio moon, sag rising, INFJ, jew, ravenclaw, bi / pan (i get confused about the diff)
person who doesn't matter: *says something mean to me*  me: i'm gonna frame this in gold so i can torture myself with it the rest of my life
are you going to spend the rest of your life being scared of everything?  looks that way
my tits feel anxious
we regret to inform you that you'll be this person forever
wait, what does society want me to do again
“just try and enjoy the moment”  “what?”
starting to get the feeling i’m not happy
sorry, i can’t, i’m still trying to win my mother’s approval
married to the game and the game is isolation
there's nothing to fear but fear itself and also the dying process, the uncontrollable, the strange fact that we exist, other humans
person: are you in the mood to-  me: no
i want 5 boyfriends, 2 girlfriends and to be left alone
my daily affirmations: 1. uh oh 2. what's wrong with me? 3. am i dying? 4. i'm dying

i didn't want things to end badly, i wanted them to end with you being obsessed with me
it’s not you it’s serotonin receptors
i wouldn’t call it a panic attack so much as being waterboarded by my own brain chemistry
am i going to have a panic attack again at 5 AM?
people on twitter are so mean that when someone is nice i’m scared they’re being mean
hi
migraines are my side bitch, panic attacks are my main bitch
i don't take selfies because i hate myself
when they say “the internet is freaking out!!!” they just mean six annoying people
maybe she's born with it, maybe it's a defense mechanism

everything was mediocre and a lot of shit hurt
perfect date: leave me alone to eat in the dark in a parked car
roses are red, violets are blue, i'm scared of genuine intimacy

sorry but i'm busy wasting my life
when people flirt with me i'm like do you have any experience with anxiety disorders
expecting good things to happen is dangerous
people are like "just be yourself" but i don't like her
when I said it's all good I meant everything's fucked
i’m the it girl of my kitchen
i wouldn't call it anxiety so much as sometimes the world starts melting and i'm not on drugs
cause of death: your girlfriend’s instagram
almost got out of bed
wanna come over and not exist together
it's friday night and i'm nothing
one time i tried to have a life and it was a disaster

hello 911, i can’t stop texting with my ex-boyfriend

someone wanted to interview me for their article about “the rebranding of loneliness” (lol) and when i didn’t they blocked me 😂
i’ll be at the revolution in one sec, i just need to figure out how to get out of bed
woke up  confirmed i hate everything   went back to bed
i only like people before we are together or after we break up
sometimes i wander around los angeles eating diet mini cheesecakes with my finger and wonder if an ex is watching me from a van
i only achieve anything so i can post it on fb and hope this dude i blew in a stairwell will see it
my will to live is contingent on trying to prove something to my exes
i’m selfphobic
confuse me like you mean it
roll up to the club in a persistent feeling of impending doom
