one last thing, i promise, not all trans men have male privilege because male privilege - like all privilege - stems from how one is read.
oh, and if your trans politics can be summed up as "I hate AFABs", you're a misogynist :D

But also there just seems to be a level of closeted gay bigots can live with, that doesn't work for a closeted tran.
So the things we're getting are coming from people who are more aware than ever that they're losing.
That's probably partly because the last few years have made it obvious how transparent and malicious that whole effort was.
That was disingenuous, but no-one's trying to 'save' or 'heal' us. There's no direct analogue for the 'ex-gay' thing.

And I will call that bitch out for all that as fast as I will a rapist.  I've done that on my main. I only don't bc of another admin.
(which is why she went back into the closet) - is a virulent racist - dogpiles black and brown people - thinks venture capitalism is good
- Insists on being THE VOICE of trans women on panels despite being so cowardly as to never claim transness because it's bad for business
Let's take a list of what Brianna Wu has done:  - Attacks sex workers. - Befriends TERFs and conversionists - Takes opportunities from TW
How about the admin that posted this shuts up?  You can call people out for being rapists without instantaneously defending Wu.
We'll make a big show of calling her out but we'll only subtweet people who've done way way worse shit. Smdh.
The irony here is that BriWu gets more shit publicly than rapists and abusers do in our community. Case in point, this account.
just like all the black people you've added to your blocklists proves you're a racist ass.
honestlyyyyy, all that adding every single trans person on twitter onto your blocklist except those who kiss your ass proves you're a terf.

Trans women are thrice as femme as cisgender women and thrice as butch for that matter too.
WPATH docs spend years feminizing a single trans woman and gatekeep her up to a million times to produce the finest girls known to mankind.
and have been practicing makeup with her almost 2 years now. I can even break binaries of solid gender with my trans woman.
I myself feminized a genuine trans woman in San Francisco with 200 delestrogen shots (that's about $20,000)
Trans women deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that. I should know what I'm talking about.

We oughta rebrand as Common Cis Apologist Girl until we can get this silly bullshit under wraps.
LMFAO at an admin on Common Trans Girl being like "well we can't expect the cis folks to recognize us when we're so mean to them!!!"
Yes, because part of the reason we say fuck cis queers is they don't recognize our plight better. You're being extremely disingenuous.
Overturning LGBT discrimination ordinances != LGBT bathroom panic, there's a clear difference.
It's so fucked to pretend that this is solely about us when a lot of straight cis people just see trans as an advanced form of gay.
HB2 overturned LGBT discrimination ordinances. In Mississippi, the anti LGB shit nestles comfortably next to the T. https://t.co/kc60J1FXXI
I dunno, is it weird to find it weird to go 'fuck cis queers' 6 days a week and 'now recognize our plight better' on the 7th?
Those views aren't incompatible they actually go together quite well: they both push for recognition of our plight and I think you know it.
Wanting recognition in general queer contexts doesn't conflict at all with wanting recognition in the situations that affect us specifically
'we should drop the T from LGBT' magically becomes a good opinion when it comes from a tran
US: 'LGBT' doesn't ever include us LGBT ORGS: anti-LGBT bathroom laws ALSO US: fuck you, stop including us
"Oh, we know, we just think that people are more likely to try and help you if we characterize it as a general LGBT issue."  ...  Fuck.
You can admit that a bad thing is happening specifically to trannies, my dudes.

We'd do t-shirts, if dividing up money between an ever-changing number of trans girls wasn't the worst idea https://t.co/g6FNKPl3mL
Not to suggest that the future is automatically *better*, but we're definitely going to look pretty weird to our descendants.
Studying medieval history is often weird because it's hard to internalise almost everyone sincerely believing in regular divine intervention
Looking forward to 'there are two genders and you can't switch' being one of those things humanity looks back on like 'we thought that?'
'Religion was organised largely around the worship of a deity referred to as The Discourse, which may be a covering name.'
'From this find it's apparent that they competed for key resources, named 'restrooms' and 'favs', whose meaning is unclear.'
'American/European culture of the early 21st century seems to have depended on ritualised insults towards a tribe known only as the Cis'
Or Trump wins, future archaeologists dig our tweets out of the ruins, and attribute civilizational collapse to a group called 'the afabs'
Undergrads yet to be born, taught by professors who are trans kids now, will read them and think, 'wow, being a tran used to really suck.'
People think we're shitposting, but it's all for posterity. In 40 years all our bad tweets will be archived in some gender studies dept.
Where are they getting these ideas from? And what are they going to come up with next?
So far in cis people: - peeing in astronaut diapers - pretending to be trans to sneak into restrooms - taking a trans person's former name
Meanwhile, another cis guy is so upset about the T that he's trying to turn himself into a walking deadname https://t.co/DYPd0mhx6z

If gender is bad why does it feel so good?
no one tran should have all that gender
I can't say that that doesn't bother me. There are no white trans people who can readily be counted on to actually be nuanced w their takes.
I can't say that that doesn't bother me. There are no white trans people who can readily be counted on to actually be nuanced w their takes.
As one of 2 (IIRC) nonwhite admins...I think it's safe to say that I can find more nuance with cis POC than white trans people.
frfr, consider that maybe there needs to be more nuance in conversations re: heterosexuality + trans people. :D
Since you wanna hot take yourself into looking like a dickhead, just take pleasure in knowing...at least it won't be you!
If you fix yourself to come up with an edgy hot take that includes shitting on binary het trans women consider that it's us who get killed.
If you say "the gender binary isn't real but binary trans people are and they're not queer" maybe you're just a hypocritical piece of shit.
Nothing any trans people do is seen as reinforcing normative gender or sexuality. Period.
"Binary heterosexual trans people aren't automatically queer just cause they're trans" is the coldest take I've heard in ages

Sometimes things are said just about women and that's okay. It's okay! If something is about women for a bit the world won't end, friends.
I was wondering how long it'd take before this got a "but have you considered emphasizing non women's experiences in this tweet about women"
The first year of transition is more well documented and has more importance placed upon it than the first year of most presidencies
Smh can't believe I'm up here espousing transitionerist rhetoric yet again
If you're on the fence about being a woman let me just tell you that having tits is pretty much the best

Good idea.  (Do my truck driver idea. It's really hot.)

Do this, because it's safer.  Even though nothing can beat the rush of hooking up with strange truck drivers from Craigslist.

We don't need more visibility, we need discussions about concrete methods to ease the pain of transition and fight legal battles worldwide

I dunno why cis people think trans folks are uncommon. Seems like there's a tran in every room I walk into!
There's a politics of respectability that's deeply embarrassed by the existence of sex workers and other bad transes. We want no part of it.
Cis people don't need help hating us. Unless they go full Jenner, don't act like a trans person's means of identifying is the enemy.
Further: don't act like the way they choose to identify or market themselves is selling out your precious movement.
Reminder: don't shame sex workers, and don't act like their work makes their opinions - about anything - intrinsically any less valid.

But when your gender seems to be largely predicated on 'trans women cannot be a thing' then it seems fair to at least mention
This is delicate and awkward because we don't want to throw either non-binary people or self-identification under the bus
not least because it could be easily read as 'trans woman internalises so much transmisogyny she decides it's impossible to be that'
especially when that same writer is like 'I started transition and hormones BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE A WOMAN so I'm third sex'
if you're getting your opinions on trans women from the writer of rocky horror picture show then I don't even know what to tell you

Anyway time to explain my thoughts on capitalism and its capacity to benefit the world. First of all,
Proud to announce that I've successfully transitioned into a cis chick. I'm still going to speak for trans people and say tranny anyway tho.
apparently hospital staff don't like you hollering 'fighter star power, make up' right before they take you in for surgery
If it's not going to put you in danger, coming out/transitioning is the single best thing you can do for yourself.
You know your own life best, but whenever I see the second category I always want to reassure people.
Bad (but always understandable) reasons not to come out: - I'm scared - I'm 'not trans enough'
Good reasons not to come out: - It would compromise my safety/job/money/housing
Being out makes some things harder, but it makes a lot of things much easier.
As much as it sucks, I've never felt that transition wasn't worth doing.

'Thank you for commenting and reminding me of all of this, friendly cis ally.'
'Oh, does this look cheap? I don't know what not-cheap is supposed to look like and I couldn't afford it if I did.'
Add in the extra scrutiny society throws on women's appearances, especially ours, and they turn into expensive social minefields.
Not being socialised to learn what makeup to buy and use when, or how to build a wardrobe of clothes, those are inconvenient on their own.
No-one ever talks about how expensive femininity is, specifically for trans girls, and not counting surgery or hair removal.
LESBIAN: I'm a lesbian MEN: but LESBIAN: no MEN: however
And really, what better introduction to lesbianism and womanhood all at once is there?
Transitioning from a gay guy to a lesbian is a great way to experience being unwillingly trapped in a relationship or marriage with a man.
Seems things have cooled down, so we're probably safe to run this. Which sexuality is better and more valid overall?
Just dial it up one notch further. 'No you're pretty.' 'I am sewage, you are as a goddess to me, spit in my face to make it prettier'

gotta keep up those topical tweets to keep our #brand #relevant
[aliens land in Los Angeles] ALIEN: we have learned about your species by intercepting something called 'good trans posts' US: oh no
We're sorry for everything. Most of our excuses were given out of pain. There's no one to blame but ourselves.
If you're that keen to believe trans women are into 'forcefemming minors' then you have been spending too much time around TERFs
Our mentions: a story in two acts https://t.co/lIoJsv9XvE

You don't know shit about what it's like to be a trans girl, about our neuroses, our trauma and our fears, so stop being so fucking horrible
Every little turd thinks they get to tell trans women how to behave, how to relate to the world, how to be funny
STOP coming into our mentions if you are not a trans girl, telling us it's not ok to behave like trans girls. Fuck. Off.
MY balls are bigger than my penis tho
The tweet is gone and we're sorry for it. We're changing who and how you can post to the account as well to avoid this.
Honestly looking around to see what cute effeminate men would make cute girls is a trans past time and we won't be shamed over it
Ppl just digging through our old stuff to get offended by lmao
We've shown that we're accountable and we're making steps to improve that accountability in the future.  Everybody relax.
The offending tweet is deleted everyone! Hooray!
we've had a lot of writer changes as this account has progressed, and we were hoping past people would not use it https://t.co/yNlR7ZasPV
I can't speak for how the others plan to handle this, but I'd like to make sure only the people whose names are in the bio are posting.

You know you fucked up with a joke when your mentions are half people saying it's hurtful and half anime avatars begging you to keep it.
(Dot-replied because we can't reply to every callout in our mentions and this is the best explanation I can do for now.)
Anyway I don't really feel like I can apologise for a joke I didn't make but I am pretty uneasy about it and I'm not sure what to do with it
I'm not sure how we got to the point of alienating whole huge swathes of trans twitter, other than that we are people and people disagree?
I want to quit the account over our pattern of repeatedly tweeting the grossest things, but where else could I make dick jokes to &gt;1k people
Trans day of screaming? You mean EVERY day?
I hope they drop the T and prove us r right that after gay marriage would come total and absolute betrayal.

Personally, I think my jokes about my past are hilarious.  But I guess they're also problematic.  A bad trans struggle.

rebrand ideas:  an account that uses the term cuck.  Good Cuck Posts.
it's about ethics in...uhhh....  bad jokes journalism.
Ignore this.  Men with dicks love girls with dicks.  They love us. They let me call them daddy!
Although for real, men with dicks don't appreciate their dicks like girls with dicks do, in my opinion
This marks the first time this account has come close to doing a terrible thing and then not doing it, our brand is ruined forever
As a hyperdyke I was about to tweet something mocking het trans girls, but then I remembered everyone does that
gather round.  let me tell you a story.  of when i transitioned 5 years ago  so men could give me their money and let me call them daddy.
And much like dogs, a surprising number of men have a dead one secretly buried in their back yard
Thanks to our lower life expectancy, trans girls actually age in dog years
...i think i really am the oldest on this account.  fuck i'm old.
i'm actually 70 in tran years  so now a daddy can show me his man gears  something something  i cannot write poetry  but im good at hoetry.

Trans girl: you can be attractive and beautiful and not just a fetish. You can be attracted to other people. All of these things are okay.
Thankfully, we'll always have TERFs and other scum to throw that 'maleness' back in our face whenever we try and break out of it.
Being 'male' when a trans girl is like piloting a huge lumbering robot you can barely control. Everything is huge, and wrong.
A good and fun thing about dysphoria is feeling like an enormous creep for being attracted to women. Or, well, anyone.

It's important that we be a community people feel welcome in, whatever their background. ...so yes, it is okay to not like Death Grips.
What's important is that you feel safe and supported as you navigate the stupid, stupid expectations of society.
But there's no trans girl archetype, and that fact frustrates the piss out of TERFs because it means we're not the trend they think we are.
It's pretty damning to cis people that most of the experiences we share the most have to do with them being shitty to us.
If you don't identify with the things we post, it doesn't make you any less trans. There's no right or wrong way to be that.
The idea of a common trans girl account is bad; there's no such thing. Our experiences vary so widely that we could never cover them all.
If you have questions, learn the trans girl way: by never asking and feeling bad about yourself instead

The lesson here being: do not listen to cis people when they try to explain us to us.
All it takes is one asshole to be 'well actually you're a' and then you're thrown right out of it. Including right back into misogyny.
Trans men experience misogyny, and cis people will never get this because they don't know what it's like for your gender to be that tenuous.
We're super mad at that one internet-famous cis women for saying trans men can't experience misogyny, because: - it's wrong - that's our job

If you're on a date with a cis man, mention being trans and he says 'oh, *great*', run. You'll end up buying him dresses, or in his basement

Trans people going mainstream means that pretty soon we'll have Absolut Trans. Revolting and alcoholic, just like us! http://t.co/bIgijUdEZX
I love Nevada. Now that it's The Official Trans Girl Novel, no-one has to publish, buy or read anything else by one of us.

RT if this comes down hardest on trans girls of colour, because everything does
RT if half of trans girls have a homeless trans girl sleeping on their couch because cis people can't stand to be in the same house as us
And, uh, DM us for the details if you're in Seattle
RT if you'd house a homeless trans girl

Nice to see cis people moving away from the old-fashioned 'overtly hound the trans high school student to suicide' tactic, anyway.
This is funny because it's actually progress. And not, because it isn't.
Last week 200 Missouri high school students walked out of classes to protest a trans girl using the girls' locker room.

Following Gawker's lead, our writers have voted to organise. We're now affiliated with International Sisterhood of Shitposters Local 302.
For what it's worth from a dumb joke account: if you haven't made it there yet, you will. And it's going to be okay.
It doesn't happen all at once. You can have good days and bad days. But eventually you're stronger than you ever thought you could be.
The real transgender tipping point is when you switch from being afraid of everything to being so jaded you get fearless and unstoppable
Us, online: yo check out this gross dick incision Us, IRL: am I brave enough to wear lipstick outside today
Tip for dealing with street harassment: painstakingly describe the surgical procedure for GRS at them
they totally do cut the balls off, though so partial credit?
*puts her head in her hands* For the last time, transphobes, they don't 'cut it off'. They cut into quarters, invert it and use the glans-
What does a normcore trans girl aesthetic look like
CIS PERSON: so have you had The Surgery yet? JADED TRANS GIRL: yeah it was basically like this http://t.co/eXxL57gRg3
Circumgender paradoxtrans mode: - get a cast of it made into a strap-on - get GRS - peg somebody with your real fake dick
How's that for autogynephilia?
An excellent transition plan: - get a dildo made from a cast of your dick before starting hormones - eventually, GRS - go fuck yourself
Sometimes genital dysphoria really is as simple as 'this is an A+ dick, for someone that isn't me to have'
If you need proof no trans project will ever work, just look at this account.
There won't ever be a trans commune because we'll all fuck and then hate each other and call each other abusers and exile each other too.
We hate cis people, but we're not separatist. Thats impossible. Trans women can't build a functional online community let alone an irl one.
It'd be cool if trans girls could donate their dicks to trans guys, because: - I want this thing off of me - but it's a pretty nice dick tho

Alternatively, flood the search field by using the word 'TERF' in completely unrelated tweets. Wake up? TERFs. Work sucks? TERFs.
If you're worried about TERFs finding you talking about TERFs and being TERFly at you, this might be useful: http://t.co/rQuompDl6z
'Well of course you'd say that, *Steve*' [trans girl does not melt into a pool of acid] 'Actually it's Furiosa now.' '...'
A fun thing with TERFs is watching them treat deadnames like 'true names' with magical powers and being shocked it doesn't work.
All this time we spent alienating people and letting the side down, it was all part of our master plan.
You can screencap literally any of our tweets to make trans women look bad - that's basically our brand - so we're kind of immune?
Do Electric TERFs Dream of Vaporwave?
While this is hilariously creepy of them, if you don't need that kind of drama you could start calling them, IDK, cis supremacists instead?
FYI there's a TERF Twitter account searching the word 'TERF' and screencapping tweets to try and make trans women look bad.
That isn't a joke, just a thing you need to do. FYI.
A good thing to do is to care about the lives and safety of trans women of colour.

"Let a hundred flowers blossom, let a hundred schools of thought contend"
Please can we leave the angry politics people to do that thing and go back to our extremely bad trans jokes? That would be nice.
Well that's enough engaging that.  Have any of you pissed on anyone yet?
I love to get my historical perspectives on 1930s dictators from The Trans Girl Cathartic Joke Account
I recommend that people learn about the Holodomor and the Katyn Forest Massacre.  This is an earnest FUCK. JOSEPH. STALIN.
This is a serious request for an explanation because it doesn't make sense. Or is this one of those things that'll never make sense?
But someone please explain why we're Holocaust deniers for not liking Stalin.  This is the weirdest event to ever happen on GTP.
End Stage Capitalism: A trans twitter account about piss and dicks is currently engaged in a Twitter war for the soul of Twitter communism.

Another fun thing: you don't get to class yourself as more trans, or better at it, or more pure about it. There's no grading system.
For our last problematic tweet of the night:   Fuck Joseph Stalin.  Also, buy the writings of Leon Trotsky.
Labor history tweet: Joe Hill was such a trans girl
A fun thing about transness: nobody owns it and you don't get to kick other people out of it.
Eddie Redmayne in The Danish Girl is fake trans. A trans person who is trans in a way you don't like, is not.
Never call anyone 'fake trans', it's an awful thing to do. Unless they're literally a cis actor playing a trans character.

[cis voice] this is an obvious trans. I can tell by the chromosomes and from having seen a lot of trans in my time
But even if they did: you have no idea. So why even bring it up?
It's not as if they matter in terms of gender identity, or gendering people correctly. That's just politeness.
You can't see someone's chromosomes from their Twitter account. You can't see someone's chromosomes from how they dress or look. Shut up.
[extremely cis voice] im gendercritical i kno trans womens is secret men's becuase cromsms
Less terrible politics, more tweets about piss and/or cocks please
Also we don't like straight-up fascism, and we've got some deep reservations about that Stalin chap.
We at Common Trans Girl believe that all trans women are lovely, regardless of our ideology.  ...except Anarcho-Capitalists.  Don't be that.
I'm a Left-Libertarian so right-libertarians and leftists hate me :(  Read "Libertarianism Without Inequality".  How's that for discourse?!
Anyway, we don't care about ideology. We care about trans girls, not being a dick, and vaporwave.
If you think our communism is bad, you should see our liberalism
I actually switched parties to another third party this morning.  American Common Trans Girl opposes the two party system.
'I think markets should drive change!' 'Because that's never backfired. I think government should drive change!' 'Because that's never backf
Also there is room for reasonable people to disagree on how to implement change and stuff Just don't be a fascist pls
I mean, or do, we're a Twitter account not a cop
Absolutely do not do this
Now for our most problematic tweet yet:  Vote Libertarian in 2016.
'you don't care about-'  We are saying. That. A. Neat. Thing. For. You. To. Do. Is. To. Care. About. And. Value. Trans. Women.

Vaporwave is bad but hating men can be a necessary act of self-care sometimes when you're not one. Something something radical praxis.
Yes. Vaporwave.
We are trying to be less combative, though. So... vaporwave?
110% pure misandry, all the time.
I feed off of the rage of the halfwits who try and troll us.
Gosh but we're getting subtweeted a lot today. That certainly is an unusual thing, to happen, on this account.

Strange: trans TERFs Also strange: intersex TERFs
they think feminism ended in 1973 and they like trying to hurt young trans girls in a rather creepy predatory way
'what is a terf' well it's like a normal woman who wants to yell at you for being trans only a lot more and while calling herself 'radical'
